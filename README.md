This is a base for a possible game on Android developed using MonoGame engine.

There is no UI because it's hell of a work to make UI in MonoGame (and I was not in the mood to lose my interest to
game developing itself wasting hours to create presentable start menu or score system);
and another thing, on this stage our plane is not only a bomber but a destroyer too,
because for testing reason when it makes contact with a building it's not destroying,
instead building blocks are disappearing.

As I've become more and more discouraged by MonoGame and left for Unity after all,
I stopped working on this game and have no intention to do it any time soon.

So you can use this game or its parts for you own needs as you like, I won't complain.
